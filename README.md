# Ghost Mode
The spookiest SCP:SL Gamemode!

## What is Ghost Mode?
Ghost mode is a gamemode for SCP:SL that simulates a ghost that has breached into the facility!
Meaning a specialty task force called TEAMX has to go in and exterminate the ghost!
(Its not a real Task Force btw)

## Config
```
ghost_enable: true - Enables or disables the plugin!
```

## Guide
- Install the plugin
- When you're server is on the scene "WAITINGFORPLAYERS", go into the RA console and type 'ghost_start' and it will start the round as a ghost round!
Really simple <3

## How does it work?
TEAMX is comprised up as an NTF squad, A Commander (with an added 300 HP), 3 Lieutenants (with varying health), And cadets (with added 100 HP).

TheGhost team is comprised up with one person as the TUTORIAL Role, which he has an added 500 HP! He is also invisible, but be aware when he talks he can be seen!
